<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Niels! I am a PhD candidate at the Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics of the TU Delft (Netherlands). 
  I work in the Discrete Mathematics & Optimization group under the supervision of Leo van Iersel. 
  Previously, I obtained my MSc and BSc degrees (both cum laude) in Applied Mathematics from the TU Delft.
</p>

<p>My research is focused on algorithms and mathematical theory of phylogenetics: the study of evolutionary history of organisms. 
  I also work on parametrized complexity, specifically concerning the parameter scanwidth. 
  Writing software and applying algorithms to real-world data is also something I enjoy doing.
  On this webpage, you can view publications and software I wrote, and conferences I have attended / presented at.
