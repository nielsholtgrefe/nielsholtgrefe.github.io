<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Niels! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>
  I am a PhD candidate at the
  <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics">Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics</a>
  of the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft</a> in the Netherlands.
  I work in the
  <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics/discrete-mathematics-optimization">Discrete Mathematics &amp; Optimization</a>
  group under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://leovaniersel.wordpress.com/">Leo van Iersel</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My research is focused on algorithms and mathematical theory of phylogenetics: the study of evolutionary history of organisms.
  I also work on parametrized complexity, specifically concerning the parameter scanwidth.
  Writing software and applying algorithms to real-world data is also something I enjoy doing.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I obtained my MSc and BSc degrees in Applied Mathematics at TU Delft, both with <em>cum laude</em> distinction.
  In the fall semester of 2024 I was a research visitor at ICERM, Brown University (Providence, RI, USA) as part of the semester program on <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/program/semester_program/sp-f24#section-2">Theory, Methods, and Applications of Quantitative Phylogenomics</a>.
