## About me
Hi, I am Niels! ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD candidate at the [Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics) of the [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the Netherlands. 
I work in the [Discrete Mathematics & Optimization](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics/discrete-mathematics-optimization) group under the supervision of Dr. [Leo van Iersel](https://leovaniersel.wordpress.com/). 

My research is focused on algorithms and mathematical theory of phylogenetics: the study of evolutionary history of organisms. 
I also work on parametrized complexity, specifically concerning the parameter scanwidth. 
Writing software and applying algorithms to real-world data is also something I enjoy doing.

Previously, I obtained my MSc and BSc degrees in Applied Mathematics at TU Delft, both with cum laude distinction.

On this website, you can view my [publications](/publications/) and [software](/software/), as well as [conferences](/conferences/) you might have seen me present or attend.
