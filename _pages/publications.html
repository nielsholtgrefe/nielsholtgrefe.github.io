    In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic networks are graphs that provide a flexible framework for representing complex evolutionary histories that involve reticulate evolutionary events. Recently phylogenetic studies have started to focus on a special class of such networks called semi-directed networks. These graphs are defined as mixed graphs that can be obtained by de-orienting some of the arcs in some rooted phylogenetic network, that is, a directed acyclic graph whose leaves correspond to a collection of species and that has a single source or root vertex. However, this definition of semi-directed networks is implicit in nature since it is not clear when a mixed-graph enjoys this property or not. In this paper, we introduce novel, explicit mathematical characterizations of semi-directed networks, and also multi-semi-directed networks, that is mixed graphs that can be obtained from directed phylogenetic networks that may have more than one root. In addition, through extending foundational tools from the theory of rooted networks into the semi-directed setting - such as cherry picking sequences, omnians, and path partitions - we characterize when a (multi-)semi-directed network can be obtained by de-orienting some rooted network that is contained in one of the well-known classes of tree-child, orchard, tree-based or forest-based networks. These results address structural aspects of (multi-)semi-directed networks and pave the way to improved theoretical and computational analyses of such networks, for example, within the development of algebraic evolutionary models that are based on such networks.

    The inference of phylogenetic networks, which model complex evolutionary processes including hybridization and gene flow, remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. Until now, statistically consistent inference methods have been limited to phylogenetic level-1 networks, which allow no interdependence between reticulate events. In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for a statistically consistent inference method for a much broader class: semi-directed level-2 networks that are outer-labeled planar and galled. We precisely characterize the features of these networks that are distinguishable from the topologies of their displayed quartet trees. Moreover, we prove that an inter-taxon distance derived from these quartets is circular decomposable, enabling future robust inference of these networks from quartet data, such as concordance factors obtained from gene tree distributions under the Network Multispecies Coalescent model. Our results also have novel identifiability implications across different data types and evolutionary models, applying to any setting in which displayed quartets can be distinguished.

      A core goal of phylogenomics is to determine the evolutionary history of a set of species from biological sequence data. Phylogenetic networks are able to describe more complex evolutionary phenomena than phylogenetic trees but are more difficult to accurately reconstruct. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing methods to infer semi-directed phylogenetic networks. As computing such networks can be computationally intensive, one approach to building such networks is to puzzle together smaller networks. Thus, it is essential to have robust methods for inferring semi-directed phylogenetic networks on small numbers of taxa. In this paper, we investigate an algebraic method for performing phylogenetic network inference from nucleotide sequence data on 4-leaf semi-directed phylogenetic networks by analysing the distribution of leaf-pattern probabilities. On simulated data, we found that we can correctly identify with high accuracy the undirected phylogenetic network for sequences of length at least 10kbp. We found that identifying the semi-directed network is more challenging and requires sequences of length approaching 10Mbp. We are also able to use our approach to identify tree-like evolution and determine the underlying tree. Finally, we employ our method on a real dataset from Xiphophorus species and use the results to build a phylogenetic network.

      We consider the fundamental question of which evolutionary histories can potentially be reconstructed from sufficiently long DNA sequences, by studying the identifiability of phylogenetic networks from data generated under Markov models of DNA evolution. This topic has previously been studied for phylogenetic trees and for phylogenetic networks that are level-1, which means that reticulate evolutionary events were restricted to be independent in the sense that the corresponding cycles in the network are non-overlapping.<br>
      In this paper, we study the identifiability of phylogenetic networks from DNA sequence data under Markov models of DNA evolution for more general classes of networks that may contain pairs of tangled reticulations. Our main result is generic identifiability, under the Jukes-Cantor model, of binary semi-directed level-2 phylogenetic networks that satisfy two additional conditions called triangle-free and strongly tree-child.<br>
      We also consider level-1 networks and show stronger identifiability results for this class than what was known previously. In particular, we show that the number of reticulations in a level-1 network is identifiable under the Jukes-Cantor model.<br>
      Moreover, we prove general identifiability results that do not restrict the network level at all and hold for the Jukes-Cantor as well as for the Kimura-2-Parameter model. We show that any two binary semi-directed phylogenetic networks are distinguishable if they do not display exactly the same 4-leaf subtrees, called quartets. This has direct consequences regarding the blobs of a network, which are its reticulated components. We show that the tree-of-blobs of a network, the global branching structure of the network, is always identifiable, as well as the circular ordering of the subnetworks around each blob, for networks in which edges do not cross and taxa are on the outside.    </div>

Semi-directed networks are partially directed graphs that model evolution where the directed edges represent reticulate evolutionary events. We present an algorithm that reconstructs binary \(n\)-leaf semi-directed level-1 networks in \( O( n^2) \) time from its quarnets (4-leaf subnetworks). Our method assumes we have direct access to all quarnets, yet uses only an asymptotically optimal number of \( O(n \log n) \) quarnets. When the network is assumed to contain no triangles, our method instead relies only on four-cycle quarnets and the splits of the other quarnets. A variant of our algorithm works with quartets rather than quarnets and we show that it reconstructs most of a semi-directed level-1 network from an asymptotically optimal \( O(n \log n) \) of the quartets it displays. Additionally, we provide an \( O(n^3) \) time algorithm that reconstructs the tree-of-blobs of any binary \( n\)-leaf semi-directed network with unbounded level from \( O(n^3) \) splits of its quarnets.</div>

    With the increasing availability of genomic data, biologists aim to find more accurate descriptions of evolutionary histories influenced by secondary contact, where diverging lineages reconnect before diverging again. Such reticulate evolutionary events can be more accurately represented in phylogenetic networks than in phylogenetic trees. Since the root location of phylogenetic networks cannot be inferred from biological data under several evolutionary models, we consider semi-directed (phylogenetic) networks: partially directed graphs without a root in which the directed edges represent reticulate evolutionary events. By specifying a known outgroup, the rooted topology can be recovered from such networks. We introduce the algorithm <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Squirrel</span> (<u>S</u>emi-directed <u>Qu</u>arnet-based <u>I</u>nfe<u>r</u>ence to <u>Re</u>construct <u>L</u>evel-1 Networks), which constructs a semi-directed level-1 network from a full set of quarnets (four-leaf semi-directed networks). Our method also includes a heuristic to construct such a quarnet set directly from sequence alignments. We demonstrate <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Squirrel</span>'s performance through simulations and on real sequence datasets, the largest of which contains 29 aligned sequences close to 1.7 Mbp long.

    Phylogenetic networks can represent evolutionary events that cannot be described by phylogenetic trees, such as hybridization, introgression, and lateral gene transfer. Studying phylogenetic networks under a statistical model of DNA sequence evolution can aid the inference of phylogenetic networks. Most notably Markov models like the Jukes-Cantor or Kimura-3 model can been employed to infer a phylogenetic network using phylogenetic invariants. In this article we determine all quadratic invariants for sunlet networks under the random walk 4-state Markov model, which includes the aforementioned models. Taking toric fiber products of trees and sunlet networks, we obtain a new class of invariants for level-1 phylogenetic networks under the same model. Furthermore, we apply our results to the identifiability problem of a network parameter. In particular, we prove that our new class of invariants of the studied model is not sufficient to derive identifiability of quarnets (4-leaf networks). Moreover, we provide an efficient method that is faster and more reliable than the state-of-the-art in finding a significant number of invariants for many level-1 phylogenetic networks.

  To measure the tree-likeness of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a new width parameter that considers the directions of the arcs was recently introduced:
  <em>scanwidth</em>. We present the first algorithm that efficiently computes the exact scanwidth of general DAGs. For DAGs with one root and scanwidth
  \( k \), it runs in \( O(k \cdot n^k \cdot m) \) time. The algorithm also functions as an FPT algorithm with complexity
  \( O(2^{4\ell - 1} \cdot \ell \cdot n + n^2) \) for phylogenetic networks of level-\( \ell \), a type of DAG used to depict evolutionary
  relationships among species. Our algorithm performs well in practice, being able to compute the scanwidth of synthetic networks up to 30 reticulations
  and 100 leaves within 500 seconds. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic that obtains an average practical approximation ratio of 1.5 on these networks.
  While we prove that the scanwidth is bounded from below by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph, experiments suggest that for networks

Phylogenetic networks are a specific type of directed acyclic graph (DAG), used to depict evolutionary relationships among, for example, species or other groups of organisms. To solve computationally hard problems, treewidth has been used to parametrize algorithms in phylogenetics. In the hope of simplifying the algorithmic design process, Berry, Scornavacca and Weller [BSW20] recently proposed a new measure of tree-likeness that takes into account the directions of the arcs: <i>scanwidth</i>. They showed that the corresponding decision problem of this parameter - which can be seen as a variant of directed cutwidth, using a tree instead of a linear ordering - is NP-complete. This thesis aims to widen the structural knowledge of scanwidth and to find efficient ways of computing it on general DAGs, both by exact and heuristic algorithms.<br>
With the help of reduction rules, we construct an explicit dynamic programming algorithm that computes scanwidth exactly, along with its corresponding <i>tree extension</i>, in \( O(k \cdot n^k \cdot m) \) time for rooted DAGs of scanwidth \( k \). This slicewise polynomial algorithm proves that computing the scanwidth is in the complexity class XP. The algorithm also functions as an FPT algorithm for networks of level-\(ell\), with the complexity bounded by \(O(2^{4 \ell - 1} \cdot \ell \cdot n + n^2) \). It performs well in practice, being able to compute the scanwidth of networks up to 30 reticulations and 100 leaves within 500 seconds.<br>
On the heuristic side, an algorithm that repeatedly splits at a specific type of smallest cut is proposed. Enhanced with simulated annealing, this heuristic shows promising results, obtaining an average approximation ratio of 1.5 for large synthetic networks of 30 reticulations and 100 leaves. Applied to a real-world dataset of networks, the heuristic performs near-optimal. Although we prove that the scanwidth is always greater than or equal to the treewidth, experiments show that they are close to each other in practice. This further motivates the use of scanwidth over treewidth as a parameter in algorithms.

In this thesis we analyse the class of <i>maximum coverage</i> problems. For all discussed problems, linear programs are formulated. Using the notion of <i>submodularity</i>, we prove that for the weighted version of the basic <i>Maximum Coverage</i> problem, where the weights differ per set, a polynomial-time greedy algorithm guarantees a \((1 - 1/e)\)-approximation of the optimal solution. This improves the already known bound of \((1 - 1/e - \varepsilon)\), for all \(\varepsilon > 0) \). We then show that the same result holds true, if we allow elements to be covered by multiple sets. Furthermore, a completely novel extension is introduced, where weights differ per combination of sets. It is proved that, under the assumption that the weights are submodular and increasing, a greedy algorithm still provides a \((1 – 1/e)\)-approximation.<br>
The latter algorithm is tested in the framework of optimal sensor selection. To this end, we consider all official weather stations in the Netherlands as our sensor group. We test the performance of the approximation algorithm, if some of the assumptions do not hold and no theoretical bounds exists. Corresponding weights are calculated, using two approaches: <i>inverse distance weighting</i> and <i>multiple linear regression</i>. For both approaches the in practice performance of the greedy algorithm is shown to be even higher than \((1 – 1/e)\), even though not all assumptions hold. Finally, the corresponding selection of weather stations is shown.
